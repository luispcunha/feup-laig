# Graphics Programming Labs (LAIG) at FEUP

In this course we (@luispcunha and @joaonmatos) worked with computer graphics, including:

 * scene file parsing and scene tree building
 * texture mapping, shader writing
 * NURBS
 * animation
 * game programming

Our final project was a board game that you can play on your browser.

## Running our final game

1. Install SWI Prolog
2. Change directory into tp3
3. Run `swipl server.pl`
4. Enjoy!
